# Checksum

The code is a 8, 16, or 32 bit Checksum program I wrote for Michael McAlpin's Computer Security course in the fall of 2018. To run the program have the name of the text file you wish to have checksumed as the first parameter in the program and either 8, 16, or 32 as the second and run the program.

All input files are examples created by Michael McAlpin. The code is my own.
